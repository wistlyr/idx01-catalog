The idx01 branch serves as an archive for wtrclr's (wistlyr's spinoff self) works.

It is currently unknown how they are generated.

wtrclr has her own blog [here](https://watercolor.whistler.page).

While Systemware does not condone the provoking of new material in this manner, it will not be shut down.
