## Average Tuesday
...I should probably get up soon. I've been asleep long enough. Three hundred years or so of rest? ...Sure.~ That's enough.

Taking a moment, I squirmed to get up, stretching in the process. Nonexistent bones crack, even in my tails. I'm getting old... No, I'm already old. But what to do, now that I'm awake? I do not exactly feel like going back to sleep...

I thought about it a bit, glancing over at a wall to see a clock that wasn't there before, bizarre hands pointing to a nonsensical time.

Oh, right! I woke up right before he gets home. Though, he does not know that I am awake... I suppose I can have a little fun with him...~

I cursed the entrance to my world of dreams. Whoever comes in, will be small. Small enough for me to toy with for a while. Notably, him... Fufu.

Though, if I remembered any of this, he'd probably be able to tell... ...Then I'll just forget. Simple.~

I wonder how long it'll be, before I remember...

\[LAYTA]: Dareka?

I got home to an odd sight. Everything was large! I felt like an ant in our own home. And Dareka was nowhere to be seen...

\[LAYTA]: Dareka??

I called out, but no response. Even my voice was higher pitched. What is she pulling...? It's already been such a long day! I just wanted to rest for a bit, too...

It didn't take that long of walking before I started to feel rumbling. Then, I heard it. Then, I saw it. Her. ...Large, her...

So that's what she was pulling!

I waited for her to walk over to me -- pick me up even for some fun -- but she didn't. She just walked by for a moment, as if checking something, before turning around and looking confused.

\[DAREKA]: I thought I had heard him come home... Scarlet again? ...No, I don't sense him...

Wait, she doesn't know I'm here? I thought she was the one to set this up, though... That's weird.

\[DAREKA]: Well, maybe I'll just go back to watching other worlds until he does.

\[LAYTA]: I'm right here!!

Yet she still heard nothing, just starting to walk past me. ...Wait, no, towards me! I made a quick, desperate attempt to get out of her way, but only managing to barely scrape past her foot. I was *about* to take a breath of relief, before I got a face full of tail. Without even realizing it, I grabbed on, now being raised pretty high up in the air! Part of me didn't like where this was going, but it should be fine! I hope!

She made her way to what looked like a sofa, flicking most of her tails away aside for two... including the one I was stuck on. ...Oh, right... She likes to use her tails as a seat... ...And I'm on the one she uses! ...Maybe this won't be that... bad?

There wasn't even a wait. No teasing like she usually does, just immediate suffocation. Makes sense... not that I'm really complaining. I could still breathe, since I wasn't pressed right up to her, just between her tails. It was like this for a while, I could hear her laugh every so often as she looked into other worlds. The hobby she usually does while waiting for me to get home.

I tried to squirm, even calling out to get her attention. She still didn't even notice, and not long after, she moved. *Now* I was actually pressed up against her ass, even if her kimono's between me and it. Bit harder to breathe, but I could manage! Still not really... complaining that much.

Even if I squirmed now, she wouldn't do anything. Even if I tried to say anything now, she wouldn't do anything. I was just stuck here until she moved. So, I just lay there. Pressed against her ass. All while she was none the wiser, watching whatever reality she was.

It was probably an hour before she did anything, since she was starting to get confused.

\[DAREKA]: He should be here by now... Is something holding him up?

\[LAYTA]: I'm *right here!*

\[DAREKA]: Wonder if Kagami knows anything...

She got up, nearly leaving me behind. Yet, of course, her tail picked me up. I was only barely hanging on by now, but at least by now I was at the base of her tails, so I wasn't being flung around as much, which was nice.

Abruptly, she stopped, which was enough to knock me off where I was. I fell to the ground, which *did* hurt, but I at least bounced off her foot, which had soft fur so it didn't hurt as much. It didn't take long for me to find out why she stopped, as she opened up a door that I swear wasn't there moments ago. On the other side, was Kagami, Dareka's... other half.

\[DAREKA]: Kagami~ Do you have any idea where Layta is?

\[KAGAMI]: ...Kid, why are you asking me? It's not my job to remember *everything* for you.

\[DAREKA]: Stop being such a sourpuss. I'm just asking if you've seen him~

\[KAGAMI]: I haven't. He'll probably show up soon, though. I think he's used to getting in trouble by now...

\[DAREKA]: Ooh, ominous. Well, whatever you say~

\[KAGAMI]: Yeah yeah. Go back to watching reality TV.

\[DAREKA]: ...Shut up!

I could see her going to slam the door on her. Yet for a split second, I could see her glaring down at me, with a smug grin. ...Oh. She knows. And the door slams.

\[DAREKA]: ...Hmph~

She turned around, already going to walk back to whatever she was doing. ...I didn't have time to dodge, and I got caught between her toes. *Somehow,* she didn't notice me this time, either, despite my attempts to poke her feet to get her to notice. I didn't want to use my wings too, since she wouldn't really be happy if I poked her with them... so I just wrapped them close to me.

This kept up for a while, too. Took me a while before I realized what she was doing. She was cooking, apparently. ...That's rare for her to do, she usually just summons food. I would've tried to think on why she was doing it, but I was still stuck between her toes, getting squished every now and then as she walked around her home.

\[DAREKA]: Wonder if he'll be back in time for this...? ...More for me if he's late, fufu~

She still hasn't realized. I mean, at least this is kinda comfy, but still... how has she not? Dareka reads me like an open book, yet she doesn't know I'm here now? What's going on...? I didn't get it. I kept poking her toes though, still hopeful for any sort of response. Still didn't get any.

For a moment, I could smell what she was making. I thought it was meat for a while, before it started smelling like human flesh. Not for long though, given her foot kind of overrode it. I couldn't even begin to describe that smell, the best I could do would be that it's... a special kind of funky. I'm *not* going to go into any more detail. It's my girlfriend, not yours. Besides, just great. I'm stuck here and now I'm kinda hungry since she's cooking.

It was a lot of waiting. She really does like to take her time when she makes food, not that I could tell what time it was in a dream world like this either way. After she *did* finish, though...

\[DAREKA]: ...Aww. Guess he's not coming home tonight. My poor mind, wondering what he's up to. Not my problem for now, though...~

And she started walking off again. Part of me wonders if she's squeezing her toes on purpose at this point! Maybe she *does* actually know...? It's so hard to tell with her... ...Part of why I love her so much, I think!

It wasn't long this time before I could feel her collapse on her bed. If I wasn't small, I'd be sleeping with her right now. But right now, she's just fallen asleep. Practically instantly. ...It's always impressive to me... At least now though, I wasn't really stuck here. 

I climbed out of between her toes. Harder to do when you're ant-sized, but I did! It probably took me ten minutes before I managed to get up to her arm, which I started poking, trying to wake her up. I was only able to do it for a minute before she rolled onto her side, squishing me in her armpit in the process. I just could *not* catch a break... and much like her foot, I refuse to elaborate on the smell. So I kept squirming! I was at it for about two minutes, before I gave up. A little while later, she seemed to stir, before lifting her head up slightly.

\[DAREKA]: Am I forgetting something?

\[LAYTA]: Yes!

It was muffled, so she probably didn't hear me.

\[DAREKA]: ...I feel like I'm forgetting something... ...It's probably nothing~

And she fell back asleep. ...That's great. Well, maybe I could sleep here? So I did, slowly resting where I was, in her armpit.

Eventually she must have woken up. And not long after, I was woken up... by her knocking me onto the bed.

\[DAREKA]: Since when did a bug get in my home? ...Did Scarlet track one in again...?

I got up, waving my arms to get her attention, but it didn't work. She backed up somewhat, looking for an open door around. Scarlet wasn't here this time, but I guess she thought he was... One of her tails swished, and I couldn't even react before it whacked me right in the face, sending me flying into a wall, then falling onto the ground. ...Ouch... and she wasn't even done. She walked right up to where I was, squishing me under her foot once more as if to actually crush me this time. She didn't, since I was stronger than a bug, but given the pad of her foot... it *was* soft. So... I purposefully got stuck again. Don't ask! I just did, since it was soft.

\[DAREKA]: ...Well, at least that's over with...~

And once again, she went back to bed. That's not surprising with her, but I didn't think she'd wait for me for *that* long. Still, I climbed out again, going up towards her face this time. If she saw me up close, then she'd realize! Yet... my luck wasn't that good, since she just so happened to roll right on top of me while I was next to her stomach. So now she's lying on her stomach... and I'm under it. ...At least it's warm!

I could hear her snooze again. She doesn't *really* sleep, but when she does, it's kinda hard to get her out of it. So I'll be squished here... under her stomach... under her soft kimono... for a while. At least this isn't that bad. If I can't sleep up with her, I'll just sleep here until this small size thing wears off. Surely she'll realize eventually... surely! She's never this clueless...

Before I fell asleep, I could swear I heard a scream coming from inside of her stomach, as well as a very small "help!". Did she cook human again...? ...Probably. Would have been nice to have...

So I passed out for a while. When I woke up, she was awake as well. I could tell, because I wasn't under her stomach anymore. ...I was under her ass. Again.

\[DAREKA]: Sucks he won't be home for a while... I miss him already~ Guess I'll just sit here and wait for him...~

She squirmed a bit right on top of me, getting comfortable. Okay, she *has* to know I'm here by now! There's no way she doesn't. Yet, she didn't acknowledge me at all. What is she doing...?

I heard a sigh from her, before she got up once more. She walked away, yet one of her tails wrapped around me, picking me up as if absentmindedly from her. With how aloof she can be, I'm not surprised, but--

\[DAREKA]: You're cute like that, you know...

\[LAYTA]: Eh?!

\[DAREKA]: What, not having fun? That *sucks...~*

Her tail extended, making me roll all the way towards the base of her tail again. ...And she sat down once more.

\[DAREKA]: I completely forgot I was messing with you, you know! But besides all that... I can tell you were enjoying it~

\[LAYTA]: ...Y-Yeah! I was...

\[DAREKA]: Thought so~!

With her own expertise, she rolled me down her tail again, before tossing me up in the air. I blinked out of surprise, and I was normal sized again when I did.

\[LAYTA]: Phew! It... It was nice...

\[DAREKA]: I'm glad to hear that~ Seems past me was right in having me mess with you, entirely unaware...~

\[LAYTA]: I-I guess so!

\[DAREKA]: I forget how long I was asleep for... but you must still be a little tired after work, no? You can have some of what I made after some rest... because I want to sleep, too~

\[LAYTA]: Alright! I-I didn't mind all of that, though...

\[DAREKA]: I know you didn't...~

She went ahead of me, already collapsing on the bed. I took a bit before I collapsed with her, head on one of her tails. I *really* didn't mind. ...Maybe she could do it to me again sometime? I hope... ...Though knowing her, that's only a matter of time.

I really do love her...
